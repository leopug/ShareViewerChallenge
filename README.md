StockViewerChallenge

This is my weekend UI challenge to create a Stock Viewer, like NASDAQ or Dow Jones Style.I use animations and I think this could be a good starting point if anyone want to do something like this. 

Features: It's infinite (: always goes around all stocks in the array. No memory leak, yey.

It's just a POC and be kind. Any feedbacks would be great!
